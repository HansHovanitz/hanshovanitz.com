## Software Developer 

### Objective
Jack of all trades, master of some. I have always had an affinity for working with computer technology. While wandering other trails in environmental protection l was exposed to some software development and web design. I began learning to program and have never looked back. 
I discovered that computer programming is truly what drives and excites me. I have worked with many languages and tools but I am never done learning. I am open to new ideas and ways of doing things, and I am able to learn new skills quickly. I am seeking an entry level or internship position because I am eager to gain experience and begin applying my computer science skills to real world problems.
