### --Creating website with Hugo and deploying to AWS S3--

A friend recommended that I give Hugo a try to set up a webpage for myself.
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a blog framework built on Go. Installing Hugo was pretty easy as was actually using it to create new pages. After selecting a theme, Markdown format is used for the blog/page content. Hugo abstracts a lot of the code. It took me a little bit of HTML manipulation to get the index page set up how I wanted it. The biggest challenge came with deployment. There isn't a whole lot in the way of tutorials on Hugo deployment let alone tutorials that specifically deal with Hugo on AWS. Eventually, with the help of [wercker](http://wercker.com/), I was able to set up auto deployment from GitHub to AWS for my static website. 

"Stuff and Things" is a rather descriptive saying I sometimes use. So, for now this site shall be known as "Stuff and Code" (since a friend already claimed "Code and Things"). I plan to add examples of projects I have done to the blogs and also discuss new projects/code/technology. Looking forward to learning some new things about web development along the way!
