### -Some 2018 Updates-

Work at AMEX is going well. I have learned a tremendous amount about what I used to call "internet programming" (building web applications). My day-to-day activities revolve around building backend `Java` microservices. As part of this I've also learned about the noSQL database `Couchbase`, CICD tools like `Jenkins` and `XL Release`, and much more. When I've had a little free time I've worked on creating `Node.js`-driven GUIs for some of the backend tools I've created. 

I was looking through my GitHub and came across the very first non-super-trivial program I started to help teach myself `Java` over Summer after taking a CS101 class. I glanced through the code and could not help but be amused at some of the design choices I made. While nowhere near the end of my learning journey, it feels good to realize how far I've come as a developer. I was 90% of the way done with the project before it was abandoned due to overwhelming schoolwork and other life-stresses. I'm thinking I'm going to finish up the project because 1) It will be a good exercise it patching together some poorly designed perhaps broken code 2) I don't like to leave dangling ends. I'll make a post about it when I take the plunge. 

Also working on updating my resume and about me sections of this blog site. That's all for now!
