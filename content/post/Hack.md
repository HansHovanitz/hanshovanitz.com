### --Hackathon--

A little while back I participated in a Hackathon at work with several colleagues. Our basic idea was to create a bounty system within our organization (and scalable to the entire company). Within the system an individual could create a ticket would relate to some issue they were having -- whether that be getting stuck on a particular piece of development or a deadline approaching too fast. The ticket/issue could then be claimed by another colleague that had some extra time or could lend a hand due to being experienced in the subject. Upon completion of the ticket the completing individual would be rewarded with company currency (redeemable for tangible rewards) as well as social clout (think gamification in the sense of the Stack Overflow site). This would help foster intersourcing and collaboration across the organization as well as speed up delivery time.

Without going into much of the implementation details, I can say that the project was block chain powered and integrated with several of our existing enterprise tools like JIRA and ServiceNow.

While our team did not win the company-wide hackathon bracket we were one of the finalists for the Phoenix site. It was a great experience and I look forward to the next Hackathon I am able to participate in! Good times!
