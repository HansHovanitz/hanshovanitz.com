### -Getting MEAN! - Todo App-

I'm currently employed as a software engineer intern (Engineer III) at American Express Technology for the Summer. I'm going to be doing some front-end development work. I haven't actually had much front-end experience so I'm really excited about this opportunity. 
In order to get some experience I created, with the help of assorted online tutorials, a simple MEAN stack To-Do list web application.

The user can add new todo events to their list, edit the events, and delete the events. When I get some free time I plan to update the app with some new functionality.

The project can be found **[here](https://github.com/HansHovanitz/MeanStack_TODO)**.

In order to get the app running you'll need to have `MongoDB` and `Node.js` installed. 
Then:

- Start MongoDB with `mongod`
- Run `npm install` to set up app dependencies
- Run `webpack`
- Start the app with `node src/app.js`
- Open the localhost in your favorite web browser (`http://localhost:3000/`)
