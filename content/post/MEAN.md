### -Getting MEAN! - Todo App-

I'm currently employed as a software engineer intern (Engineer III) at American Express Technology for the Summer. I'm going to be doing some front-end development work. I haven't actually had much front-end experience so I'm really excited about this opportunity. 
In order to get some experience I created, with the help of assorted online tutorials, a simple MEAN stack To-Do list web application.

The user can add new todo events to their list, edit the events, and delete the events.
