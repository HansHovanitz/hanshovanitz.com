### -'Out of Office' Travel App-

I've always been curious how mobile applications are created so I decided to take a mobile app development course at ASU. My team and I decided to create an app called 'Out of Office' that is used as a travel journal/diary.

When the user loads the app they must first log in to their unique account. After logging in they are taken to the Home screen where a list of posts is displayed. The posts are created either by the user or other users are listed in chronological order. The posts are of locations that various users have traveled to:

A user can create a new post of somewhere they have traveled to:

From the Home screen, a user can select their own post to edit it or they can select another user's post to get more information. They can view the location on a map and even post a comment for the other user to see:

If a user select 'My Photos' they are shown a map that displays each place they have traveled to. In this case, the user has traveled to Hollywood, Seattle, and Yellowstone.  Selecting a location will bring up all pictures that have ever been posted of that particular location. The map view functions as a sort of travel trophy case:

Xcode and the `Swift` programming language were used to build the application. I did not enjoy Xcode much at first because linking things together or enabling certain functionality often involved finding obscure checkboxes in the deeply layered menus. By the end of the project Xcode and I had at least established a working relationship though. I thought `Swift` was quite fun to work with, and can see its power to 'swiftly' develop quality apps. In the 'Out of Office' app several frameworks like MapKit were used in enhance functionality. It was fun to learn a IDE/language that are unlike others I have used and I enjoyed learning about a new type of software development.
