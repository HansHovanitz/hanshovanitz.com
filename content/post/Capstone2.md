### -Capstone Project Part2-

Work is moving along with the Capstone project. We created our initial models last sprint and are now working on creating forms, lookup tables, and a style sheet for the PatientView web application. 

I'm using a lot of new (to me) software, languages, and frameworks in this project. This has made the process thus far slightly daunting but mostly exciting! I have worked through most of the 'Django' tutorial and it seems like a solid web-framework. I have had some experience with using 'mySQL' in the past but not on a very deep level. So far I've set set up 'Django' to work with a local 'mySQL' server, run a migration using our existing models, and then run the web application as it exists currently There isn't much yet, but at least things have gotten off the ground which is sometimes the hardest part.
