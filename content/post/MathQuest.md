Math Quest is an educational virtual world game in the vein of traditional JRPGs like Final Fantasy. The game is designed for 2nd-6th graders buy anybody who needs elementary math practice may benefit. Players roam the game world and encounter various enemies who must be defeated using math.

The game was created using the [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) game engine by a team of three CS students and myself. Game scripting was done in `JavaScript` and `C#`. Our team followed an Agile process. From its inception Math Quest made it up to version 1.13 by the time the project came to a close. We were very happy with what we were able to create using excellent communication, teamwork, and dedication.
