### -Capstone Project Part3

Work has been somewhat limited over Summer, but we did get a bunch more done prior to the ending of last semester and since the last Capstone Project Update post. I cannot post the code for the PatientView application since it will belong to the Mayo Clinic, but I can show some screen shots of the progress (click on images to make larger):

When arriving to the PatientView web application the user is prompted to sign in using an existing Google account. Once signed in the user is granted access to the application (if permitted).

After signing in the user can navigate to the various PatientView pages using drop down menus that are consistent throughout the application. The pages were created with `HTML` and `CSS` to make them look pretty. The `Python` powered `Django` handles the models and other logic like populating date selectors (there may be a better way to do this logic, but we are still in the process of learning).

I'm looking forward to continuing work this project more consistently after my internship with American Express wraps up.
