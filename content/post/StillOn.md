### -Is This Thing Still On?-

Apparently having two kids under three takes a lot of time and effort. I really underestimated just *how* much. As pre-school begins to become a thing I hope to have some more time for passion projects and technology exploration. Until then I am at least making sure I'm busy and learning on the job. In the last few months I've done a major overhaul on one of our `Java` applications to make it more configuration-driven (less required deployments), contributed my first production `Go` code to an application serving thousands of business requests a day, and reconfigured a `ReactJS`-powered application to make database calls via an API instead of directly. 

This post is really just to see if my deployment flow for hanshovanitz.com still works. If you're reading this, you'll know I made it.
