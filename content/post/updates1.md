### -Some October Updates-

Life has been going a million miles a minute. My final semester in Computer Science and the ominous, but inevitable, job hunt will do that. Work on the `python`-powered PatientView web application continues (will make an update post on it soon) and I am learning new service-oriented aspects of `C#` in my Distributed Software course. I used some of my knowledge gained over summer about `Angular.JS` to create a presentation on test-driven development with an accompanying sample app (another post that needs to be made soon). A few promising job prospects have now popped up, so it is currently a very busy and exciting time!
