### -JavaScript Maze-

This was a tutorial exercise I did at the beginning of my Amex internship in order to teach myself `JavaScript`. Since all of the tools I was going to be using during the internship for web development are JS-based starting with JS itself seemed to make sense. The program isn't terribly complicated but helped me to learn JS syntax and get used to function callbacks and other code structures that I hadn't used before in OOPs like `Java` or `C++`. 


To start the game the player places their avatar in the maze:

The player then navigates the maze using the provided interface. The player can ask the program if it is a legal action to move forward. In the case pictured below it is, so the page responds "Yes!"

When the end of the maze is reached victory is achieved!
